				technologies: [typescript, reactjs, reactRouter, playwright, jest],
				livePreview: "https://my-tech-event-aggregator.web.app/",
				repo: "https://github.com/sophiavf/My-Project-Event-App",
				purposeAndGoal:
					"As a proactive software developer, I prioritize staying up-to-date with best practices and technologies by attending industry events. However, I noticed a lack of a centralised view for relevant tech events in Munich. To address this, I developed an application for my personal use that consolidates tech events from Meetup and Eventbrite into a centralised database which is then displayed on my frontend. The application utilises TypeScript, React, Playwright for data collection, Firebase (hosting, serverless functions, and Firestore database), and Tailwind CSS to enable more efficient event discovery. Jest was used to write unit and integration tests for the backend code.",
				stackExplanation:
					"I opted for Firebase because it's a robust and efficient backend-as-a-service platform by Google. It streamlines full-stack application development and offers easy integration with Google Cloud products. Firebase will also facilitate adding user authorization in the future. Firestore, a NoSQL database within Firebase, is used to store event records.",
				problemsAndProcess: [
					"Collecting data from Meetup and Eventbrite was challenging due to their different data delivery methods. For Eventbrite, I used Playwright to listen for responses containing specific text, capturing JSON data efficiently. Meetup's data was extracted from a script tag in server-side generated content.",
					"I upgraded to Firebase's paid tier to support the external HTTP requests made by the scrapers. To ensure accuracy and reliability as well as avoid any high usage bills, I thoroughly tested the scrapers with Playwright and Jest",
					"Three cloud functions, running daily, were implemented: 1)'Cleanup Events' removes past events. 2) 'Meetup Scraper' collects tech events in Munich from meetup.com. 3) 'Eventbrite Scraper' gathers free tech events from eventbrite.com. After scraping, the application compares the new data with the existing records in the database and removes any events no longer available, accounting for cancellations or changes by organizers.",
				],
				roadmap: [
					"Expand the application to allow users to search for tech events in different cities.",
					"Implement user authorization for personalized features like favoriting events.",
					"Display data on event frequencies to help organizers strategically schedule their events.",

				purposeAndGoal:
					"I embarked on creating a personal website to not only showcase my intriguing projects and diverse skill set but also to refine my proficiency in React. This platform will serve as a testament to my dedication and passion for web development.",
				stackExplanation:
					"I chose Vite as my bundler for its seamless integration with Github Pages and blazing fast build times. React.js was an obvious choice to enable component reusability and facilitate a more organized codebase. TypeScript was harnessed to ensure type safety, thus mitigating the risk of bugs. To further streamline the user experience, React Router was employed for effortless navigation among components. Tailwind CSS was key for bringing my aesthetic vision to life, ensuring a sleek and responsive modern design.",
				problemsAndProcess: [
					"Achieving a harmonious balance between responsiveness and aesthetics, particularly in the hero and projects components, was at times a challenging task. My endeavor to craft an engaging and fluid experience for all device types was met with several iterations and testing using the help of the development server and Chrome DevTools.",

				roadmap: [
					"Skills Showcase: Store skills in an array of objects, each containing an icon and the name. This will allow for a streamlined and reusable display of my technical proficiencies.",

				repo: "https://github.com/sophiavf/Project-Weather-App",
				purposeAndGoal:
					"I created a weather application that is not only secure and responsive but also a playground for deepening my expertise in React hooks. With a keen eye on proficiently managing the application's state, React hooks like useState, useEffect, and context were utilized to achieve ease of reuse and avoid prop-drilling.",
				stackExplanation:
					"The weather application boasts a serverless architecture, combining the framework Express.js with the versatility of Netlify’s AWS serverless functions. This synergy not only streamlined the hosting process but also ensured that the API keys remained protected. Tailwind CSS was used to style the components, making the application visually appealing and responsive.",
				problemsAndProcess: [
					"For this project I was faced with the challenge of scarce and outdated documentation, particularly regarding the utilization of Express for crafting an API on Netlify. The documentation was from three years ago, and some of the features had since been deprecated. Through troubleshooting and research I made it work. To make the app more dynamic, it automatically fetches the user's location based on their IP address and uses the current weather condition to retrieve a relevant photo to be used as the background.",
